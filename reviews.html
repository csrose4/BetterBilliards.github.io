                    <p> "I needed to swap a couple tables for the small property I run.
                        Mike and his crew were amazing to work with.They are friendly,
                        knowledgeable, professional, and have a great product. Mike 
                        was able to work with me within my budget and he and his staff 
                        offered stellar service. My tables look beautiful, and my residents 
                        are as happy as I am with the end result. Thank you Mike and crew,
                        I really appreciate the job well done, and thanks to Craig from
                        Connelly Billiards for referring me to them. I 100% recommend 
                        this company for all of your billiards needs."

                <h3>Rick P</h3>
                    <p> "Buying a pool table from Better Billiards was a pleasure and 
                        perfect transaction start to finish. I helped obtain a pool 
                        table for Helen Drake Senior Center in Phoenix where I am a member.
                        Mike and his crew are the best. They answered our questions, worked 
                        within our budget, no games, no hassles, no upcharges, hidden fees, 
                        etc. Delivery, install, re-felting, and setup, all included, was 
                        timely and professionally completed. Communication, followup, everything
                        was 5 Star. Highly recommended. Our table plays like brand new and the 
                        Helen Drake seniors are so appreciative. Thank you!!!"

                <h3>Jeni S</h3>
                    <p>"Donâ€™t think twice! We purchased a preowned table and posted in 
                        marketplace for a mover. After getting a few quotes and speaking
                        to him, I definitely felt like Mike was a professional in the industry! 
                        He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and I felt very confident 
                        with the crew he was sending. They were able to move the pool table the
                        next day and re-cloth. The crew, Jacob and Michael moved, assembled and 
                        clothed the table with great attention to detail. They were also very
                        knowledgeable about their products and the installation process. We had 
                        a lot of questions as first time pool table owners and they made us feel
                        and never like we had dumb questions. All very professional! Great experience 
                        in every step!"
